* Advanced String Syntax

Text is one of the most common forms of data that we will work with.

How do we add quotes and apostrophes in Python Strings?

** Escape Characters

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("Hello")
print('That is Alice\'s cat')
print('Say hi to Bob\'s mother')

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello
: That is Alice's cat
: Say hi to Bob's mother


We can have several different types of escape characters.
1. \' - Prints as Single quote
2. \" - Prints as Double quote
3. \t - Prints as tab
4. \n - Prints as newline
5. \\ - Prints as backslash.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("Hello there!\nHow are you?\nI\'m fine")

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello there!
: How are you?
: I'm fine

** Raw Strings

We can also have raw strings which should be used when we have text that includes many backslashes that we don't want to use for escape characters. There are similar to regular strings, but have "r" right at the beginning.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print(r"Hello")
print(r"That is Carol\'s cat.")

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello
: That is Carol\'s cat.

** Multiline Strings with Triple Quotes

Instead of using \n in order to put a newline in the string, it can be easier to use multiline strings.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("""Dear Alice,
Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burgularly, and extortion.
Sincerly,
Bob""")

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Dear Alice,
: Eve's cat has been arrested for catnapping, cat burgularly, and extortion.
: Sincerly,
: Bob

Above, Python automatically formats this using \n and \t in the background.

** Similarities Between Strings and Lists

Strings can use indices and slices similar to lists. The string "Hello" can be seen as a list with 5 items, each of which are individual strings.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

spam="Hello world!"

print(spam[0])
print(spam[1:5])
print(spam[-1])

print("Hello" in spam)
print("x" in spam)
print("HELLO" in spam)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: H
: ello
: !
: True
: False
: False

* String Methods

Unlike list methods, string methods return a new string value rather than modifying the existing string in place. This is due to the fact that strings are immutable.

** upper(), lower()


#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

spam="Hello world!"

spam.upper()

print(spam)

spam=spam.upper()

print(spam)

spam=spam.lower()

print(spam)


#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello world!
: HELLO WORLD!
: hello world!

This can be helpful when we allow the user to input an answer and we do not care about uppercase or lowercase. There is also a corresponding title() method.

** isupper(), islower()

These methods return a boolean value depending on whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. If we have a blank string or a string without any uppercase or lowercase characters, both isupper() and islower() will be false.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

spam="Hello world"

print(spam.islower())

spam="hello world"

print(spam.islower())

spam="HELLO WORLD"

print(spam.isupper())

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: False
: True
: True

We can also call both upper() and isupper() on the same string.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("Hello".upper().isupper())

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True

** The isX() methods

There are several other string methods that begin with is and return a boolean.

1. isalpha() Returns True if the string consists only of letters and isnâ€™t blank

2. isalnum() Returns True if the string consists only of letters and numbers and is not blank

3. isdecimal() Returns True if the string consists only of numeric characters and is not blank

4. isspace() Returns True if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and newlines and is not blank

5. istitle() Returns True if the string consists only of words that begin with an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters



#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("hello".isalpha())
print("hello123".isalnum())
print("123".isdecimal())
print("    ".isspace())
print("Hello world!".isspace())
print("Hello world!"[5].isspace())
print("This Is Title Case!".istitle())

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True
: True
: True
: True
: False
: True
: True

** startswith(), endswith()

These return true if the string value that they are called on begins or ends, respectively, with the string that is passed to the method.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("Hello world!".startswith("Hello"))
print("Hello world!".startswith("h"))
print("Hello world!".startswith("ello"))

print("Hello world!".endswith("world!"))
print("Hello world!".endswith("world"))
print("Hello world!".endswith("!"))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: True
: False
: False
: True
: False
: True

** join() and split()

The join() method is useful when we have a list of strings that need to be joined together into a single string value. It gets passed a list of strings and returns a string.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print(",".join(["cats","rats","bats"]))

print("".join(["cats","rats","bats"]))

print(" ".join(["cats","rats","bats"]))

print("\n\n".join(["cats","rats","bats"]))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: cats,rats,bats
: catsratsbats
: cats rats bats
: cats
:
: rats
:
: bats

The split method does the opposite. It is called on a string value and returns a list of strings.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("My name is Simon".split())

print("My name is Simon".split("m"))

print("My name is Simon".split("!"))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Simon']
: ['My na', 'e is Si', 'on']
: ['My name is Simon']

** rjust(), ljsut(), center()

rjust() and ljust() return a padded version of the string they are called upon in order to either right or left justify the string. They take an argument that dictates the character length of the justification. We can also give an argument to change the character that is used for the justification.

The center method works similarly, but it centers the text instead of justifying to the right or left.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

print("Hello".rjust(10))
print("Hello".rjust(30))
print("Hello".ljust(10))

print("Hello".rjust(20, "*"))
print("Hello".ljust(10, "-"))

print("Hello".center(20))
print("Hello".center(20,"*"))
print("Hello".center(20,"="))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:      Hello
:                          Hello
: Hello
: ***************Hello
: Hello-----
:        Hello
: *******Hello********
: =======Hello========

** strip(), rstrip(), lstrip()

These methods can be used when we want to strip off whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, or new lines from the right side, left side, or both sides. We can also pass a string that we want to remove instead of just the whitespace.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

spam="Hello".rjust(10)

print(spam)

spam=spam.strip()

print(spam)

print("   x    ".strip())
print("   x    ".rstrip())
print("   x    ".lstrip())


spam="SpamSpamBaconSpamEggsSpamSpam"

print(spam.strip("amSp"))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:      Hello
: Hello
: x
:    x
: x
: BaconSpamEggs

** replace()

This method looks for two arguments, a string to look for and a string to replace it with.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

spam="Hello there!"

print(spam)

spam.replace("e","XYZ")

print(spam)

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello there!
: Hello there!

** The pyperclip Module

We installed this in a previous section. It comes with copy and paste functions that lets it read and write to your computer's clipboard.

#+begin_src bash

pip install pyperclip

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| Defaulting  | to      | user       | installation | because | normal                                             | site-packages | is | not | writeable |
| Requirement | already | satisfied: | pyperclip    | in      | /home/mohammeds/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages | (1.8.2)       |    |     |           |


#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

import pyperclip

#pyperclip.copy("Hello!!!!!!")
#pyperclip.paste("Hello!!!!!!")

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* String Formatting

Often times when we want to combine strings to form a single string, we use the plus operator. However, this can get complicated when we have long strings with a lot of variables. Python has string formatting techniques that make this easier.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

name = "Alice"
place = "Main Street"
time = "6 pm"
food = "turnips"

print("Hello " + name + ", you are invited to a party at " + place + " at " + time + ". Please bring " + food + ".")

print("Hello %s, you are invited to a party at %s at %s. Please bring %s." % (name, place, time, food))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello Alice, you are invited to a party at Main Street at 6 pm. Plaese bring turnips.
: Hello Alice, you are invited to a party at Main Street at 6 pm. Please bring turnips.
