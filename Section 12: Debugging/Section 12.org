* The raise and assert Statements

Now we might start finding some more complicated bugs. Debugging is a tool that we need to learn in order to find what we did wrong.

For example, a zero divide error occurs when we try to divide a number by 0. We learned how to handle exceptions with try and except statements to deal with expected errors.

** Raising Your Own Exceptions

We can also raise our own exceptions in our code. This is a way of saying that Python should stop running the code in this function and move to the except statement.

We can raise exceptions using the raise statement.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both

raise Exception()

#+end_src
